Prior has been warned that she&apos;s a &ldquo;Divergent&rdquo; &ndash; one who doesn&apos;t fit any one group.  Collectively, the fraction&apos;s view &ndash; Detergents as dangerous since they do not conform to just one fraction and are capable of free-thinking.

		    <br><br>  <font size="3%";font face="sans-serif, Arial Arial, Helvetica, Geneva">
			Keith (Guy Pearce), a married, disheartened music teacher who wishes for his carefree creative youth.  Then, young beautiful British exchange student Sophie (Felicity Jones) comes to visit Keith's daughter.  Sophie's beauty and musical talent make Keith uncomfortable.  During this time, Keith's wife, Megan (Amy Ryan), and daughter, Lauren (Mackenzie Davis), focuses on Lauren's senior year of high school. Meanwhile, Sophie and Keith have become soulmates due to their need for artistic expression.
			<br><br>
			Guy Pearce does an excellent job playing the - me against the world - keith character. Conversely, Sophie conveys the inward-looking and ignorant insolence of a brat who's used to getting her way.  The film is very controlled and well-executed in which the passionate climax between Keith and Sophie never quite happens.
